# make_wordlist
Make a wordlist file of unique words from any input text file

A simple python script to create a wordlist from any text file, such as the custom wordlists used in the csecht/passphrase-generate repository.

Before running parser.py, the user cuts-and-pastes any source text into the default file, parse_this.txt.
Running the script provides terminal standout for number of words and writes unique words to a default, newline-delimited, utf-8 text file, named now_parsed.txt.

The source files used for the csecht/passphrase-generate repository are provided in the SourceFile directory.

parser.py was written with PyCharm using a Python 3.8 interpreter.
